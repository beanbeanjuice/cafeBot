# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, **please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue**,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Branching

Now, make sure you are forking off of/branching off of the `integration` branch located [here](https://github.com/beanbeanjuice/cafeBot/tree/integration). This allows new and upcoming changes to be pushed to a "working" directory rather than straight to the main, production directory. For example, this is how you may contribute.

Create a fork of the repository, and run the following commands in git CLI.

```
git switch integration
git checkout -b (issue-number)-(issue-name)
```

The above code switches to the `integration` branch, and creates a new branch based on the current `integration` branch. Then, you can create a pull request on GitHub with your forked repository, pushing the new branch onto the integration branch. So an example would be below;

```
git checkout -b 525-slash-commands-notification-spam
```

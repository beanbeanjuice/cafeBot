# beanBot for Discord

A bot that has an expanding list of commands for your use on discord.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is invite the server to your discord and do `!!help`!

### Commands

There are a few sections for the help command. Each section has its own set of commands. The main command is `!!help`.
To view the commands for a specific section do `!!help (section)` and for a specific command do `!!help (command)`.

The main sections are...
```
Moderation
Fun
Generic
Music
Twitch
```

### Prerequisites

Well... for one. You need a discord server, and the bot needs administrative access. Other than that, that's pretty much it!
